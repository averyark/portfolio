## Astrax Framework System

AFS (Astrax Framework System) is an **extremely** efficient framework that speeds up development and decreases the probability of bugs. All of my projects will use this private framework cultivated by myself from all the experiences I gathered throughout my 7 years long lifetime as a Roblox Developer. This system is finely tuned for my coding style and practices to ensure coherent development.

- **Debug Panel with Console Commands** This panel helps with debugging, which is great for debugging and pinpointing bugs.
