## Why me

I'm a Roblox Developer specialing in Programming and Interface Designing (UI) that had experienced up to 5 years of active development and 7 years of total lifetime in the Roblox developer industry. I have a brilliant knowledge of the Roblox game development history which allowed me to understand the ups and downs of various systems. I also have good experience with marketing learned after working with multiple smart individuals or groups. My prime strengths are the ability to adapt and grow, these are prominent skills that allow me to become an exceptionally suitable programmer and developer on the Roblox platform.

## Astrax Framework System

AFS (Astrax Framework System) is an **extremely** efficient framework that speeds up development and decreases the probability of bugs. This system is finely tuned for my coding style and practices to ensure coherent development. It is a private framework cultivated from all the experiences I gathered throughout my 7 years long lifetime as a Roblox Developer, and your game will enjoy the privileges of this system.

- **Debug Panel with Console Commands** This panel helps with debugging, it is great for debugging and pinpointing bugs.

- **Object Orientated Programming (OOP) Helper** A object helper that simplifies OOP and integrates the object classes with the debug panel and the framework. OOP will only be used when appropriate.
